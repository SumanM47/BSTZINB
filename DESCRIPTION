Description: Estimation of association between disease or death counts (e.g. COVID-19) and socio-environmental risk factors using a zero-inflated Bayesian spatiotemporal model. Non-spatiotemporal models and/or models without zero-inflation are also included for comparison. Functions to produce corresponding maps are also included. See Chakraborty et al. (2022) <doi:10.1007/s13253-022-00487-1> for more details on the method.
